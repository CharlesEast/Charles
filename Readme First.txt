Hi
When I was asked for a sample of my code, I realised I had none because in my last job, I couldn't take any with me. 
So I programmed the game my daughter plays in school.
Enter four numbers between 1 and 9, and click Guess.
Correct numbers in the correct position show as a tick.
Correct numbers in the wrong position show as a circle.
Incorrect numbers show as an X.
This isn't heavily tested - I expect there are bugs.
It's a demonstration of what I can achieve in about five hours, and it shows how I use unit tests.
Please call 07957 250803 if anything is not clear.
This was created using Visual Studio 2012.
My next task, as it's a WPF application, is to use Coded UI to add automated testing.
And to redevelop for iPhone :)
Thanks,
Charles
